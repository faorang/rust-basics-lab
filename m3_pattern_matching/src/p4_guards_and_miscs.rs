/**
 * Extra Conditionals with Match Guards:
 *
 * A "match guard" is an additional if condition, specified after the pattern
 * in a match arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards
 * are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.
 *
 * The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn't
 * try to check for exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.
